write tests, especially for beam angle changes
use multiproc to speed up data import, probably y passing subset dives to adcp_import_data
do naive shear estimate
pull in full, processed glider data
consider rotation corrections to beam centers, include beam_miss? Will afeect shear velocities both from v and z
