use multiproc to speed up data import, probably y passing subset dives to adcp_import_data (doesn't work, can't pickle the data structures)
correct for velocity. ADCP uses its own calcualted temp and a salinity of 35 ppt
do naive shear estimate
consider rotation corrections to beam centers, include beam_miss? Will afeect shear velocities both from v and z
Calculate surface drift and dive average velocity of glider
Plot return amp against depth
plot velocity variaility against depth
correct for speed of sound
correct for angle of attack and sideslip
